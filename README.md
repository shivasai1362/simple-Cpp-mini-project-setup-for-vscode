This is a simple python program to setup a mini c++ project(for practice) using vscode. You can include external libraries headers through the program for the project.
Default C++ version is 17 you can edit "tasks.json"> "configurations.cppStandard" to your specified cpp version.

Don't forget to specify your C++ project path. The program will automatically create "tasks.json" and "c_cpp_properties.json" in that specified path.
